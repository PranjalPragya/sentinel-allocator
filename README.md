# sentinel-allocator

This project is a custom memory management toolkit in C. It is designed to explore and solve the real-world debugging and stability challenges that standard allocators don't address. Malloc's issues stem from manual memory management, leading to vulnerabilities like memory leaks, use-after-free, double-free, and heap overflows.  Instead of just recreating malloc, the "Modified (Sentinel) Allocator" is an enhanced implementation that acts as a vigilant guard against common memory errors. It integrates features like canaries to detect buffer overflows, magic numbers to prevent double-frees, and fail-safe API design to stop integer overflow vulnerabilities at the source.
To demonstrate the value of these features, the source file also contains a naive "Normal" allocator. The main() function runs a side-by-side "showdown," executing identical tests on both implementations. This provides a direct, practical comparison, showing how the Normal allocator silently fails and corrupts memory, while the Sentinel allocator successfully detects and reports every error, turning difficult debugging challenges into immediate, actionable feedback.
